Put up the code for problems which interested me in Numberphile and Matt Parker's videos

Finding all the 3 and 4 digit numbers which do not resolve to their Kaprekar Constants - 495 and 6174 respectively

# 2. Calendar 

Takes any year from 1583 as input and prints the Gregorian calendar for that year.

Based on '14 type calendars' idea in Matt Parker's Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrgN-tvg53I
