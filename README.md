Put up the code for problems which interested me in Numberphile and Matt Parker's videos

## 1. Kaprekar

Finding all the 3 and 4 digit numbers which do not resolve to their Kaprekar Constants - 495 and 6174 respectively

## 2. Calendar

Takes a year as input and prints the Gregorian calendar for that year.

Works for all years from 1583, the first full year the calender began being adopted.

Based on '14 type calendars' idea in Matt Parker's Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrgN-tvg53I

## 3. Van Eck's sequence

Takes the initial term and number of terms as inputs, and prints n terms.

As the starting term can be determined by the user, each of the following OEIS links contain a relevent series.

https://oeis.org/A181391 and https://oeis.org/A171911 to https://oeis.org/A171918

The plot_van_eck.py file can plot the series using Matplotlib.

## 4. Golomb's Sequence 

Can output n terms of the sequence, or all terms with value less than n, or nth term
